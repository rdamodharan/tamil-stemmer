# Tamil Stemmer Documentation

This project provides a rule-based affix stripping iterative stemmer for the Tamil language. The stemmer is implemented using the Snowball language.

## Overview

The core of this project is the Tamil stemming algorithm, which is designed to remove prefixes and suffixes from Tamil words to arrive at their root form. This is a stemmer, not a lemmatizer, so the output may not always be a dictionary word.

## Key Components

- **[Algorithm](./Algorithm.md):** A detailed description of the stemming algorithm, including prefix removal, suffix stripping, and end-of-word adjustments.
- **[Evaluation](./Evaluation.md):** Information regarding the evaluation and performance of the stemmer.
- **`tamil-stem_Unicode.sbl`:** This is the Snowball script that defines the stemming rules for Tamil. Snowball is a small string processing language designed for creating stemming algorithms. This file is compiled by the Snowball compiler to generate the actual stemmer code (typically in C or Java).
- **`stemmer-ui.py`:** A Python script that provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for testing the stemmer.
    - **Dependencies:** Python 2.x and PyGTK 2.0.
    - **Usage:**
        ```bash
        python stemmer-ui.py [path/to/stemwords_executable]
        ```
        If the `stemwords` executable (generated by compiling the Snowball project) is not in the current directory, you need to provide its path as an argument.

## How to Use

This section outlines the steps to build and use the Tamil stemmer.

### Building Snowball with Tamil Support

You can build the Snowball library with Tamil support using either the provided patch or a pre-patched tarball.

**From SVN (against Snowball r577):**

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir tamil-stemmer-build
cd tamil-stemmer-build

# Clone the tamil-stemmer git repo
git clone https://github.com/rdamodharan/tamil-stemmer.git

# Clone the snowball code
svn co -r 577 svn://snowball.tartarus.org/snowball/trunk/snowball snowball

# Apply the patch and build snowball
cd snowball
svn patch ../tamil-stemmer/snowball-tamil.patch
make
```

**From the pre-patched tar file:**

```bash
mkdir tamil-stemmer-build
cd tamil-stemmer-build

git clone https://github.com/rdamodharan/tamil-stemmer.git

tar -zxf tamil-stemmer/snowball-with-tamil.tgz
cd snowball-with-tamil
make
```

### Testing the Stemmer

After building, you can test the stemmer using the `stemwords` executable:

```bash
./stemwords -l ta
# Enter Tamil words one per line to see their stemmed form.
# Press Ctrl-C to quit.
```
Example:
```
கண்கள்
கண்
```

### Using the Stemmer UI

The `stemmer-ui.py` script provides a graphical way to interact with the stemmer:

```bash
# Ensure stemwords executable is in the current directory or provide its path
python ../tamil-stemmer/stemmer-ui.py [path/to/stemwords_executable]
```
*Note: The UI requires Python 2.x and PyGTK 2.0.*
